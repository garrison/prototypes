Weâ€™re launching a new initiative: a collaboration between IBM Quantum developers and researchers that will give users access to software prototypes from cutting-edge research in areas like quantum simulation and machine learning. 

It can take a long time for new quantum computing techniques to make their way from original research to usable software. To help everyone get access to these tools faster, we're making them available earlier in the development cycle. 

Each prototype will be accompanied by a set of resources and documentation to guide you in applying new capabilities to your own research or industry applications, and you'll be able to engage with us and other users along the way.
